Quick Start:

1. Attach the Name Generator component to a GameObject in your scene.
2. If you want to change some text when the , drag a Text UI element to the "Text to Change"
3. Watch the Name Generator component during playback to see the generated name (good place to copy).
4. The name will also appear in the debug log.

Advanced:

To use the library directly from code, add the line below to your MonoBehavior.  

----
using RandomNameGeneratorLibrary;
----

Then create an instance of the generator.

----
PersonNameGenerator pGen = new RandomNameGeneratorLibrary.PersonNameGenerator();
----

And use its methods to create a name you can use wherever you like.

----
string name = pGen.GenerateRandomFirstAndLastName();
----


Adding or Changing Names:

Name files are located in /Resources and are formatted as text files with one name per line.

Change the lines below to match your files, if necessary.

PersonNameGenerator.cs uses these files

private const string MaleFile = "dist.male.first.stripped";
private const string FemaleFile = "dist.female.first.stripped";
private const string LastNameFile = "dist.all.last.stripped";

PersonNameGenerator.cs uses these files
private const string PlaceNameFile = "places2k.txt.stripped";
